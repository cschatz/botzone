This is a mostly-defunct site/app used to run student activities and surveys for my dissertation.

At the time, it was linked to multiple databases and individuals' records. All of this information,
along with passwords, etc. has been removed by hand, and this will not function in its current form.
Some of the pages should at least render, though.

When fully functional, this was used to track student's progress and daily tasks, using individual
users and passwords for students enrolled in the study. Tasks included to-do items, assessment suites
and survey items.
